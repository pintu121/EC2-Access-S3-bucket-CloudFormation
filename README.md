**AWS CloudFormation Template Documentation**

**Template Description:**

This AWS CloudFormation template automates the creation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with two public subnets, an Internet Gateway, a security group, and an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance. The EC2 instance is configured to have access to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. The template is defined in the AWS CloudFormation format with a version of "2010-09-09."

**Resources:**

1. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):**
   - Type: `AWS::EC2::VPC`
   - Description: This resource defines the VPC with the specified IPv4 address range, DNS settings, and tenancy. It is tagged with "Test VPC."

2. **Internet Gateway:**
   - Type: `AWS::EC2::InternetGateway`
   - Description: An Internet Gateway is created, which allows communication between the VPC and the internet. It is tagged with "Test IGW."

3. **Internet Gateway Attachment:**
   - Type: `AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment`
   - Description: This attachment links the Internet Gateway to the VPC.

4. **Public Subnets:**
   - Type: `AWS::EC2::Subnet`
   - Description: Two public subnets are created, one in each of two different Availability Zones, each with specific CIDR blocks.

5. **Public Route Table:**
   - Type: `AWS::EC2::RouteTable`
   - Description: A route table is associated with the VPC to define routing rules.

6. **Subnet Associations:**
   - Type: `AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation`
   - Description: These associations link the public subnets to the public route table.

7. **Public Route:**
   - Type: `AWS::EC2::Route`
   - Description: A route is defined in the public route table to route all traffic (0.0.0.0/0) through the Internet Gateway.

8. **Security Group:**
   - Type: `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup`
   - Description: This resource defines a security group allowing inbound traffic on ports 80, 443, and 22 from any source. It is associated with the VPC and is tagged as "Security Group."

9. **EC2 Instance:**
   - Type: `AWS::EC2::Instance`
   - Description: An EC2 instance is launched with specific attributes, including the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), key pair, network interface, and user data. User data installs the AWS CLI and copies files from an S3 bucket.

10. **IAM Resources:**
    - These resources define the required Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies for the EC2 instance to access the S3 bucket.
      - `ListS3BucketsInstanceProfile`: An instance profile for the EC2 instance.
      - `ListS3BucketsPolicy`: An IAM policy that allows listing S3 buckets.
      - `S3FullAccess`: An IAM role with an assume role policy allowing EC2 instances to assume this role.

**Note:**

This template provides a foundation for creating a network environment in AWS, which includes a VPC with public subnets and security group settings. It also demonstrates the automation of EC2 instance provisioning with specific configurations and IAM roles for S3 access.

Please replace placeholder values like the AMI ID, key name, and S3 bucket details with actual values relevant to your use case. Additionally, ensure that the security group rules are aligned with your specific security requirements.

To deploy this CloudFormation template, you can use the AWS CloudFormation service in the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
